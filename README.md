## Which challenges I completed:
- Challenge #1: Product List with Infinite Scroll ⭐
- Challenge #2: Advanced Search & Filtering ⭐⭐
- Challenge #3: Performance Optimization ⭐⭐⭐
- Challenge #4: Multi-Step Checkout Flow ⭐⭐⭐

## Key decisions and trade-offs
1st challenge: 
   For infinite scrolling an useInfinteSCroll hook was created which works with IntersectionObserver.
   Product component was refactored (using sx over style, center loader) and separated to another file.
   Missing key problem was solved just by passing the unique product id value to the "key" prop. If fetching products fails, then we show him the error text and retry button. I think that helps the user experience a lot.

2nd challenge:
   Had to do some separatings, for the code to be more readable. 
   Search and category filtering was added.
   Special hook useDebounce was created to make a delay between searches.
   Chips were used to show which filter is active. They also have button to remove them.
   Mock endpoint was modified to add sorting and price filtering functionality.

3rd challenge:
   Optimized heavy component and other item components with the help of React.memo. Set fixed height for ProductItems and created simple virtualization. Below you can see the metrics from Chrome Dev Tools performance trace (before & after):

   INP has been significantly improved to ensure faster and more responsive user interactions. However, this optimization required trade-offs that temporarily increased the CLS score. The priority was to enhance input responsiveness first.

4th challenge:
   A new component was created for the checkout page. It was placed in the App component and shows by state "checkoutOpen", but URL changes too. It will be good for user exerience (sharing, updating page, etc). Also added little responsiveness (itemsPerRow, category select). Not gonna lie, the CheckoutWizard.tsx file was generated by AI, but still I did a lot of polishing work for it to suite the site and work properly.

## How to test the features
Fetching products fails:
   Uncomment the block in onLoadMore function for it to randomly throw errors and try to fetch again.

Clear filter functionality:
   To see clear filter functionality simply select some category and type something in search input.

Cart works correctly now:
   Add or subsctract items by pressing "+" or "-", and see the cart updates.

Cancellable requests:
   Press fast on some category and see how the requests cancel in the dev tools.

Checkout functionality:
   Click on the cart to see the checkout page.
